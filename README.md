# Pitch: VIT Student Paper Archive Platform
The project to create a unified materials portal for VIT Chennai, as a student-based community initiative.

## 1. Executive Summary

Students at VIT generate a **huge volume of academic material** every semester—CATs, FATs, PATs, assignments, and internal assessments. Today, most of this material is shared **informally via WhatsApp groups**, where it quickly becomes disorganized, duplicated, lost, or inaccessible to future batches.
This proposal outlines a **student‑run, transparent, and scalable platform** that acts as a **central archive for exam papers and questions**, built *by students, for students*. The system is designed to be **legally safe, technically sound, and community‑driven**, with optional personalization and strong moderation.
The long‑term vision is not just storage, but a **searchable, topic‑wise question bank** that helps students prepare smarter, not harder.

## 2. The Core Problem

### 2.1 Current State

- Papers are shared randomly in multiple WhatsApp groups
- Files get buried under chat messages
- Same paper is resent multiple times
- No standardized naming or categorization
- No long‑term preservation for future batches

### 2.2 Why Existing Solutions Are Insufficient

- Existing VIT resources are:
   - Fragmented
   - Not student‑maintained
   - Often limited in scope or outdated
- Informal archives lack:
   - Quality control
   - Accountability
   - Searchability

## 3. The Proposed Solution

A **centralized student paper archive platform** that:

- Allows **easy uploads** with proper metadata
- Prevents **duplicate submissions**
- Enables **open access for viewing**
- Scales across schools, courses, and years
- Evolves into a **question‑bank‑style learning tool: AI would be integrated to extract data from the question papers and turn it into fun question-based quiz.**

This platform is not intended to replace official university systems, but to **complement them** in a student‑friendly way.

## 4. What Content Will Be Stored

### 4.1 Exam Papers

- CAT (all slots)
- FAT
- PAT (memory‑based where official papers don’t exist)

### 4.2 Assignment & Practice Material

- VITCOLAB assignment questions
- Screenshots or copied questions (where PDFs aren’t available)

## 5. Upload Process (Student Perspective)

1. Student uploads a PDF / image / text
2. Student fills a simple form:
   - Course Code
   - Exam Type (CAT/FAT/PAT/etc.)
   - Date
   - Slot / Shift
   - School / Department
3. System checks for duplicates
4. Paper enters the archive (or review queue)

This ensures **organization without friction**.

## 6. Access & Authentication Philosophy

### 6.1 Viewing Papers

- **No login required**
- Anyone can browse and download
- Ensures maximum accessibility

### 6.2 Uploading Papers

Two models are proposed:

**Option A – Anonymous Uploads**

- Low barrier to entry
- Moderation required

**Option B – Optional VTOP Authentication**

- Used *only* for uploads or personalization
- Never required for viewing
- No credential storage
- Fully open‑source authentication flow

This hybrid approach respects **privacy concerns** raised in discussion while still enabling verification where useful.

## 7. Personalization Features (Optional)

For users who choose to log in:

- Highlight enrolled courses
- Show relevant papers first
- Track personal contribution history
- Add papers

Non‑logged‑in users receive the full archive without restrictions.

## 8. Preventing Duplicates & Errors

- Metadata comparison (course + date + slot)
- File hash matching
- Manual reviewer intervention for conflicts

This avoids archive pollution and repeated uploads.

## 9. Community‑Driven Roles

### 9.1 Contributors

- Upload papers
- Provide memory‑based questions

### 9.2 School / Department Representatives

- Coordinate uploads for a school
- Ensure coverage
- Reduce reliance on random participation

### 9.3 Reviewers / Maintainers

- Verify metadata
- Remove duplicates
- Maintain archive quality

## 10. Incentives & Motivation

### 10.1 What We Will Do

- Public contributor profiles
- Recognition pages
- Leaderboards

### 10.2 What We Will NOT Do

- Access‑restricted incentives
- NeoPass‑style systems

Reason: These raise **TOS and disciplinary risks**, as discussed in the group.

## 11. Temporary Phase (Before Full Build)

Until the platform is ready:

- A **shared Google Drive** will act as the interim archive
- Standard folder structure
- Acts as a data source for migration later

## This ensures **immediate impact**.

## 12. Question Bank Extension (Major Future Feature)

Beyond PDFs, the platform evolves into a **question bank**:

- Filter by:
   - Subject
   - Topic
   - Exam
- Output:
   - Relevant past questions
   - Year & source

This directly addresses how students actually study.

## 13. Memory‑Based & AI‑Assisted Expansion

### 13.1 Memory‑Based Inputs

- Dedicated interface to:
   - Type questions
   - Upload screenshots

### 13.2 AI‑Assisted Processing (Exploratory)

- Clean up incomplete inputs
- Reconstruct likely questions
- Identify repeated concepts
- Generate **clearly marked** ideal solutions

AI is an *assistive tool*, not a replacement for verification.

## 14. Legal & Ethical Guardrails

- No scraping or automation on VTOP
- No credential harvesting
- No monetization or access gating
- Fully transparent, open‑source code

These guardrails were explicitly emphasized in discussion.

## 15. Development Roadmap

### Phase 0 – Ideation (Now)

- Open idea board
- Team formation

### Phase 1 – Interim Archive

- Google Drive

### Phase 2 – MVP Platform

- Upload
- Metadata
- Search & filter

### Phase 3 – Expansion

- Question bank
- Recognition systems
- AI tools

## 16. Why This Will Work

- Solves a **real, recurring pain point**
- Driven by motivated students
- Low‑risk, legal‑first approach
- Designed to scale naturally
- Flexible enough to evolve

## 17. Closing Note

This project is not just a website—it is a **student‑maintained academic memory** for VIT. With careful execution and community involvement, it can outlive batches and become a trusted resource for years.
